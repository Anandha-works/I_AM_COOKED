# I Am Cooked 🍳
Welcome to "I Am Cooked"—a place where I document the ups, downs, and crispy edges of my project journey. This repository serves as my personal record of triumphs, mistakes, lessons learned, and the occasional "What on Earth was I thinking?!" moments.

Why "I Am Cooked"?
Because sometimes I feel like my brain’s been left on the stove a little too long while working through bugs, features, and everything in between.

What you'll find here:

1.🚧 Progress Updates: Milestones and hurdles from my project.
2.🐛 Bug Tales: My most memorable "Oops" moments and how I (hopefully) fixed them.
3.🛠️ Reflections: Thoughts on what worked, what didn’t, and how I’m improving.

This is more than just a project—it’s a space where I’m keeping track of how much I’ve grown (even when things get a little overcooked).
